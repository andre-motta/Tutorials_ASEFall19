# Tutorials

This tutorials go through several machine learning algorithms, and the usage of Weka and scikit-learn.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Weka is a GUI tool based on java, and scikit-learn is a machine learning tool based on python. Make sure to install **java** and **python** in your operating system.


### Installing


* [Requirements](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/requirements.html), [Downloads](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html), [Documentation](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/documentation.html) - WEKA
* [Installation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) - Scikit-learn


## Running the example code

All the example code are written in **Jupyter Notebook**. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

### Install Jupyter Notebook

[Installation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), [Online tutorials](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

### Datasets

We use several datasets (e.g., iris, petrol consumption) in the example, all the datasets are available in this folder.

### Code style

The code style in the examples may not follow the best practice. Comments are added to help understand the examples.
